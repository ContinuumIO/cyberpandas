Install
=======

cyberpandas requires pandas 0.23 or newer. On Python 2, the 3rd party `ipaddress`
module is required (it's built into the standard library in Python 3).

Once pandas is installed, cyberpandas can be installed from conda-forge::

    conda install -c conda-forge cyberpandas

Or PyPI:

    pip install cyberpandas
